responses:
  utter_goodbye:
    - text: "Goodbye! Have a great day!"

    - text: "What is the patient's age?"
  utter_ask_age:
    - text: "What is the patient's age?"
  utter_ask_systolic_blood_pressure:
    - text: "What is the patient's systolic blood pressure?"
  utter_ask_diastolic_blood_pressure:
    - text: "What is the patient's diastolic blood pressure?"
  utter_ask_thrombolysis:
    - text: "Has the patient received thrombolysis? (Yes/No)"
  utter_ask_cholesterol:
    - text: "Does the patient have cholesterol issues? (Yes/No)"
  utter_ask_nihss_score:
    - text: "What is the patient's NIHSS score?"

  utter_thank_you:
    - text: "Thank you for the information. Let me predict the distrage_mrs."
  utter_confirm_prediction:
    - text: "Sure, I can help with that! Iï¿½ll ask you some questions about the patient to predict `distrage_mrs`."
  

  utter_greet:
    - text: "Hello! How can I assist you today?"

  utter_ask_statistical_test:
    - text: "Which statistical test would you like to perform?"

  utter_ask_causes_or_guidelines:
    - text: "Would you like to know about causes or guidelines?"
    - text: "If you like, I can use my A.I. to propose ways to improve patient outcomes. Otherwise, we can look if your hospital meets WSO guidelines."

  utter_cause_or_effect:
    - text: "You can choose to either analyse the cause of this increase or I we can explore how this effects your patients. What shall I do for you?"

  utter_ask_plot_type:
    - text: "What type of plot do you want to create?"

  utter_ask_selected_value:
    - text: "What value you want to see?"
    - text: "I can also show you the median value for your country. I can also use some statistical tests to validate if the difference between quarters is real. How should I help?"

  utter_submit_create_plot_form:
    - text: "Great! I will create the plot with the specified details. Is there anything else I can help you with?"

  utter_ask_build_model:
    - text: "Shall I use my A.I. abilities to find some possible causes for this difference? Or would you rather analyse the impact of this change on patient outcomes?"

  utter_ask_local_predictors:
    - text: "These are based on data from multiple hospitals in your country. Should I perform this analysis only for your hospital? Otherwise, tell me which indicator you want to explore."
    - text: "Can you provide details about the local predictors?"

  utter_explore_effects:
    - text: "Would you rather look at: mRS at discharge or NIHSS?"

  utter_new_selected_value:
    - text: "Here is the new selected value."

  utter_start_prediction:
    - text: "Let's start the prediction process."
